## Overview of the statistical analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis was to use Tableau to analyze the Citi Bike data from the Des Moines area. We were to analyze who is using the app, when are they using it most, how long are they using it, on which weekdays, and what areas are most popular for pick-up and drop-off, etc. Once analyzed, we created dashboards and stories to help tell the story of what the data was saying, to help sell the product further in newer areas.

## Results:
### Let's begin with the first page of the Tableau Story:

Here we can see there are 2.3 million users, with 1.9 million being subscribers, and 443,865 being customers. Among those numbers it is further broken down into gender to see how many is who, and to further get an idea who's using Citi Bike. You can see that males dominate with 1.5 million users, while 588,431 users are female, and 225,521 are unknown. It goes to show how much more males use the app, and you can use that in either direction in advertising -- to decide to mainly focus on males, or to market promoting both male and women to increase female usership.

This screenshot details tripduration by users and broken down by gender. You can see with both graphs that most tripdurations are quick. In the top graph for all users, the checkout time was between 1-30 minutes, with it's peak at 5 minutes, and really plateaus at 47 minutes. After the 5 minute mark it declines steeply. In the second graph it tells the same story but is broken down between gender for added insight. Overall it displays how  long the users overall and by gender are using the bikes and for how long. It can give an insight to what they're using the bikes for-- quick trips? Quick exercise runs? It can be something to be looked into further because if we know why a user is using the product and for what, it can help the company market and target their audience better and improve the user experience.

The third screenshot displays the rider use by hour and gender. In the 'August Peak Hours' graph, we were able to figure out the peak hours for a popular summer month. For both males and females, they had peaks at 8:00am and 5:00pm, and minor peaks at 12:00pm, and 6:00pm. You can also see the amount of bike trips by gender, and using this information the investors can get an estimate of how many bikes will be needed in the area and could use this information for further future analysis.

The final screenshot are graphs showing trips by weekday and gender. Sundays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were very popular days, especially between 6:00-9:00am and 5:00-7:00pm during the weekdays, and between 10:00am-5:00pm during the weekends. With the other graph, it's complimentary to also add the breakdowns between genders and also between usertypes. You can see that females and males who use Citi Bike are subscribers, which is great for Citi Bike who will have a steady stream of income which can be used to demonstrate growth and user interest. 

Future analysis recommendations:
The first will be what was recommended above which was to find a way to get user data to see what their users are using the bikes for-- is it for transportation to work? Just a quick trip? Exercise? It will help to understand the tripduration data, and better understand what the user is using the product for, and better market and target Citi Bike's audience, and improve the user experience. Another would be to see the most common routes and pickup/drop off locations to better place bike locations, and can use the frequently used bike routes to collaborate with city tour guides to use our bikes for easy city travel with their routes as well. It can also can be marketed as enviornmentally friendly, and would be great advertisement overall which would add more customers vs subscribers, but that'll be a great form of income that can be expected to during high tourist season.
